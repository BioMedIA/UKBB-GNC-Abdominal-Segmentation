## Getting Started

First, check dependencies in requirements.txt and make sure they are installed in your environment. Then, abdominal organ segmentations for the UKBB and GNC studies can be obtained with 4 straightforward steps detailed below. 

### Requirements
If you want to install them, simply run the following:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Obtaining Predictions

### Arguments
Folder names can be set as preferred. Details of arguments that will be used in the script are as follows:
```
zip_folder        = Folder that contains downloaded zip files for each subject. 
nifti_folder      = Folder that contains subjects with stitched volumes as .nii.gz files
nnunet_folder     = Folder that contains subjects formatted for nnUNet
prediction_folder = Folder that contains final predictions
output_folder     = Folder that contains predictions with the original naming
dataset_name      = Either ukbb or gnc
num_channels      = Either 1 or 4
```

### Step 0: Download data 
Download and put whole-body MRI data into a single directory. (Note: you can put 1st and 2nd visits of a subject in the same directory.)


### Step 1: Run extract_ukbb.py or extract_gnc.py 
This is the initial pre-processing step (only run either UKBB or GNC script depending on your source of data).

```
python extract_ukbb.py 
    --zip_folder my_original_data/ 
    --nifti_folder my_nifti_data/
```
The script takes into account of multiple visits in the UK Biobank. Therefore, the ```my_nifti_data``` directory may include different visits of the same subject as separate subdirectories. We follow the UK Biobank's naming convention so these subdirectories will be named as "SubjectID_VisitID".

### Step 2: Run convert2nnunet.py 
The script converts files to the nnUNet naming.

```
python convert2nnunet.py 
    --nifti_folder my_nifti_data/ 
    --nnunet_folder my_nnunet_data/ 
    --dataset_name ukbb 
    --num_channels 4
```


### Step 3: Run predict.py 
The script generates the predictions for abdominal organs (example below is for UKBB with 4-channel model).

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 
RESULTS_FOLDER=models/ 
python predict.py 
    --nnunet_folder my_nnunet_data/ 
    --prediction_folder my_predictions/ 
    --dataset_name ukbb 
    --num_channels 4
```


### Step 4: Run convert2original.py 
The script converts predictions back to the original naming.

```
python convert2original.py 
    --prediction_folder my_predictions/ 
    --output_folder my_outputs/
```


All organ segmentations are saved into the output folder with their original naming convention.
